<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This page ("Privacy Policy" or "Policy") provides our policies and procedures for collecting, using and disclosing your information and outlines the security measures we've put in place to protect the information that you store using AI Peak Biz's services, including the services made available through this web site, and any other software or services offered by AI Peak Biz in connection with such services (the "Services"). By using these Services, you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>What Information Does AI Peak Biz Collect and Store?</h2>

<p><strong>Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>When expressing an interest in obtaining additional information about the Services or registering to use the Services, AI Peak Biz requires you to provide your personal contact information, such as your name, company name, address, phone number, and email address (these are referred to below as your "Personal Contact Information"). When purchasing the Services, AI Peak Biz also requires you to provide financial and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the number of employees within the organization that will be using the Services ("Billing Information").</p>

<p><strong>Data, Diagnostic &amp; Login Information</strong></p>
<p>Using AI Peak Biz's Services, you will be able to create, upload, store and share information such as company description, email ID, logo, photos, custom emails, user email IDs, etc. (this is collectively referred to below as "Data"). This information will be stored and maintained on AI Peak Biz's web site. If you run into technical errors in the course of using the Services, AI Peak Biz may request your permission to obtain a crash report along with certain logging information from your system documenting the error ("Diagnostic Information"). Such information may contain information regarding your Operating System version, hardware, browser version (and .NET version information in case of Windows systems), and your email address, if provided. Additionally, certain login information is maintained in a cookie stored locally on your computer (i.e. not on a server) in order to streamline the login process ("Login Information").</p>

<p><strong>Analytics Information</strong></p>
<p>As you navigate AI Peak Biz's website and use our Services, AI Peak Biz may also collect information through the use of frequently used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons ("Website Navigational Information"). Website Navigational Information includes standard information from your web browser (such as browser type and browser language), your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, and the actions you take on AI Peak Biz's website (such as web pages viewed and links clicked). Collectively, this information is referred to as "Analytics Information."</p>

<p>Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website or other websites. Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting Ads Settings or by visiting www.aboutads.info.</p>

<p><strong>Geo-Location Information</strong></p>

<h2>What Does AI Peak Biz Do With the Information It Collects?</h2>

<p>As with any other business, it is possible that in the future, AI Peak Biz could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by AI Peak Biz, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy until it is amended.</p>
